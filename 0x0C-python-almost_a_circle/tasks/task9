9. Update #1
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes:

**kwargs can be thought of as a double pointer to a dictionary: key/value
As Python doesn’t have pointers, **kwargs is not literally a double pointer – describing it as such is just a way of explaining its behavior in terms you’re already familiar with
**kwargs must be skipped if *args exists and is not empty
Each key in this dictionary represents an attribute to the instance
This type of argument is called a “key-worded argument”. Argument order is not important.
